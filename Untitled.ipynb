    "## 4. Methodology and Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "To test this hypothesis, the following steps will be taken:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Filtering and Preparation:\n",
    "- Filter the dataset to extract data relevant to Volkswagen’s sales from 2000 to 2023.\n",
    "- Aggregate the data by year to observe yearly trends.\n",
    "- Compare Volkswagen's sales trends with those of other car manufacturers before and after 2015 (the year of the emissions scandal).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preliminary Visualizations:\n",
    "- Create a time series plot to visualize Volkswagen’s annual sales from 2000 to 2023.\n",
    "- Overlay this with other manufacturers' sales trends to compare the patterns.\n",
    "- Highlight the period around 2015 to identify any potential disruptions or deviations in the sales trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistical Analysis:\n",
    "- Conduct a statistical test (e.g., t-test or Mann-Whitney U test) to check for significant differences in Volkswagen's sales before and after 2015.\n",
    "- Compare Volkswagen’s performance against other top car manufacturers to see if the change in sales differs from the market-wide trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Control Group:\n",
    "- As a control, analyze sales trends for another car brand unaffected by the emissions scandal (e.g., a Japanese manufacturer) to determine if the 2015-2023 period impacted the broader market.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Results and Discussion:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualization Findings:\n",
    "- Provide insights from the time series plots. Did VW's sales drop in 2015? How does this compare to other brands?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistical Test Results:\n",
    "- Summarize the results of your hypothesis test, stating whether or not the emissions scandal had a statistically significant impact on VW sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Market Comparison:\n",
    "- Discuss how VW's sales trends compare with other manufacturers before and after 2015. Did VW recover? Were other brands impacted similarly?\n"
